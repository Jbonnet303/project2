Mixologist Mountain 

Concept:
Mixologist Mountain is a website for professional and entrepreneur bartenders looking for great product
deals and brand new recipe ideas. Within the website you are able to navigate through the product and recipe pages to view and buy the latest products and recipes of your choice.

Timeline: 
My first step was to build the website and connect it with a database. After I created a basic format for the website I then created the seven restful routes. The next step I took was to build out the website's pages and the functionality.
